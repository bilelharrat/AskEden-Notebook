I don't just answer questions; I orchestrate the world's most advanced AI models, route your query to the best one for the task, and then process every response through EVES â€” the Eden Verification and Encryption System. EVES checks answers for accuracy, consistency, and evidence, eliminating hallucinations at the root. Crucially, it also keeps your data private by applying end-to-end encryption to all your conversations, ensuring they are secure and for your eyes only. What you get isn't just fast â€” it's trusted, auditable, and private intelligence, designed for professionals who can't afford uncertainty."
